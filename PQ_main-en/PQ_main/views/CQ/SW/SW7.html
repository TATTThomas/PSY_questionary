        <h2><strong>What is level of
            arousal?</strong></h2>
        A person's Level of Arousal can be described as a function of alertness, situational awareness, vigilance, level of distraction, stress and direction of attention. In effect, how ready a person is to perform appropriate tasks in a timely and effective manner.
        <br><br>
        Somewhere in between the two extremes, a point of optimum-arousal, which is appropriate and effective for the situation, will exist allowing for optimum performance. At this point it seems that our mental capacity, situational awareness, alertness, attention, vigilance, decision-making, and actions are all heightened in sensitivity and execution â€“ we are in the zone.
        <br><br>
        Our performance at work is also affected directly by the number, complexity and intensity of stressors present and the amount of subjective stress that we are experiencing. There is also a direct relationship between stress and arousal. It is therefore useful to connect levels of arousal with levels of stress. The Yerkes-Dodson Stress Curve is a simplification that can help to explain the relationship between arousal and performance.<br>

        <h2><strong>Factors Affecting Level of Arousal</strong></h2>
        <p>The factors that facilitate a person to perform at an optimal level are variable and peculiar to the individual, however, certain elements are often common, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>workload</li>
          <li>task complexity and difficulty</li>
          <li>task familiarity and past experience</li>
          <li>circadian rhythm (i.e. previous rest/duty cycles and the time of day or night)</li>
          <li>degree of associated risk if failure occurs</li>
          <li>personal, and crew, motivation</li>
          <li>the working environment</li>
          <li>levels of personal stress</li>
          <li>health</li>
          <li>interpersonal relationships at work (cooperation and coordination)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Organisations, teams and individuals can take positive actions to facilitate optimum performance, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>moderating and adapting the working environment</li>
          <li>pre-planning and briefing to share workload</li>
          <li>cross-monitoring and checking procedures</li>

          <li>employee well-being programme (including stress management)</li>
          <li>cultivating a professional safety culture</li>
